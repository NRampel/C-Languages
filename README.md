A collection of all my C, C++, Embedded C, and C# files (as I learn C#). For my Embedded C codes that start with "eece287," I worked on them with a lab partner, feel free to check his linkedin and his projects as well! https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-stern-frisenfelds/


(NOTE: MY C AND C++ CODES ARE ON AN EXTERNAL DRIVE, I WILL UPLOAD THEM WHEN TIME PERMITS!!!!!)
